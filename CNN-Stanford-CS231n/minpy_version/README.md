# CS231n Winter 2016 Homework MinPy Version
The MinPy homework for CS231n Winter 2016

Date: Aug. 28, 2016

This homework is based on the [assignments](http://http://cs231n.github.io/) of CS231n Winter 2016. [CS 231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) is a Stanford course taught by Fei-Fei Li, Andrej Karpathy, and Justin Johnson. This tutorial is built on the original `numpy` version of CS 231n assignments and demonstrate how to use `minpy` to speed up the common machine learning experiments with GPU acceleration and auto derivation of gradient function.

Note: the first assignment is neural network basics and is deliberately unchanged. It is still in `numpy` so just download the [original homework assignment 1](http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2016/assignment1/).

This homework has a companion solution. Please contact Professor [@zzhang-cn](https://github.com/zzhang-cn) for details.
