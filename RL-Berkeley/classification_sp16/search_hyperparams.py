    Question 8: Evaluate various setups of hyperparameter and find the best one.

    Args:
        learning rate, momentums, batch_sizes are lists of the same length.
        The N-th elements from the lists form the N-th hyperparameter tuple.

    Returns:
        A model that corresponds to the best hyperparameter tuple, and the index
            of the best hyperparameter tuple

    Your implementation will train a model using each hyperparameter tuple and
    compares their accuracy on validation set to pick the best one.

    You must use MinibatchStochasticGradientDescentSolver.

    Useful methods:
    solver.solve(...)
    model.accuracy(...)
